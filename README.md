## Creator

This gem was forked from and created by Houdini
Github page can be found here: https://github.com/Houdini/two_factor_authentication

## Features

* Support for 2 types of OTP codes
 1. Codes delivered directly to the user
 2. TOTP (Google Authenticator) codes based on a shared secret (HMAC)
* Configurable OTP code digit length
* Configurable max login attempts
* Customizable logic to determine if a user needs two factor authentication
* Configurable period where users won't be asked for 2FA again
* Option to encrypt the TOTP secret in the database, with iv and salt

## Configuration

### Initial Setup

In a Rails environment, require the gem in your Gemfile:

    gem 'two_factor_authentication'

Once that's done, run:

    bundle install

Note that Ruby 2.1 or greater is required.

### Installation

#### Automatic initial setup

Generators have been removed due to incompatibility with mongoid

#### Manual initial setup

If you prefer to set up the model manually, add the
`:two_factor_authentication` option to your existing devise options, such as:

```ruby
devise :database_authenticatable, :registerable, :recoverable, :rememberable,
       :trackable, :validatable, :two_factor_authenticatable
```

Add the following fields to model

```ruby
  field :second_factor_attempts_count, type: Integer, default: 0
  field :encrypted_otp_secret_key, type: String
  field :encrypted_otp_secret_key_iv, type: String
  field :encrypted_otp_secret_key_salt, type: String
  field :direct_otp, type: String
  field :direct_otp_sent_at, type: DateTime
  field :totp_timestamp, type: Time
```

#### Complete the setup

Add the following line to your model to fully enable two-factor auth:

    has_one_time_password(encrypted: true)

Set config values in `config/initializers/devise.rb`:

```ruby
config.max_login_attempts = 3  # Maximum second factor attempts count.
config.allowed_otp_drift_seconds = 30  # Allowed TOTP time drift between client and server.
config.otp_length = 6  # TOTP code length
config.direct_otp_valid_for = 5.minutes  # Time before direct OTP becomes invalid
config.direct_otp_length = 6  # Direct OTP code length
config.remember_otp_session_for_seconds = 30.days  # Time before browser has to perform 2fA again. Default is 0.
config.otp_secret_encryption_key = ENV['OTP_SECRET_ENCRYPTION_KEY']
config.second_factor_resource_id = 'id' # Field or method name used to set value for 2fA remember cookie
config.delete_cookie_on_logout = false # Delete cookie when user signs out, to force 2fA again on login
```
The `otp_secret_encryption_key` must be a random key that is not stored in the
DB, and is not checked in to your repo. It is recommended to store it in an
environment variable, and you can generate it with `bundle exec rake secret`.

Override the method in your model in order to send direct OTP codes. This is
automatically called when a user logs in unless they have TOTP enabled (see
below):

```ruby
def send_two_factor_authentication_code(code)
  # Send code via SMS, etc.
end
```

### Customisation and Usage

By default, second factor authentication is required for each user. You can
change that by overriding the following method in your model:

```ruby
def need_two_factor_authentication?(request)
  request.ip != '127.0.0.1'
end
```

In the example above, two factor authentication will not be required for local
users.

This gem is compatible with [Google Authenticator](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447?hl=en).
To enable this a shared secret must be generated by invoking the following
method on your model:

```ruby
user.generate_totp_secret
```

This must then be shared via a provisioning uri:

```ruby
user.provisioning_uri # This assumes a user model with an email attribute
```

This provisioning uri can then be turned in to a QR code if desired so that
users may add the app to Google Authenticator easily.  Once this is done, they
may retrieve a one-time password directly from the Google Authenticator app.

#### Overriding the view

The default view that shows the form can be overridden by adding a
file named `show.html.erb` (or `show.html.haml` if you prefer HAML)
inside `app/views/devise/two_factor_authentication/` and customizing it.
Below is an example using ERB:


```html
<h2>Hi, you received a code by email, please enter it below, thanks!</h2>

<%= form_tag([resource_name, :two_factor_authentication], :method => :put) do %>
  <%= text_field_tag :code %>
  <%= submit_tag "Log in!" %>
<% end %>

<%= link_to "Sign out", destroy_user_session_path, :method => :delete %>
```
